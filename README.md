📘 Project Overview: Software-Project
This repository contains a basic demo of a full-stack web application that includes user registration, login, and dashboard access functionality. The project simulates a simple web-based interface for Sanothimi Campus, featuring two main roles: User and Admin.

🔐 User Features
      Users can register with their personal details.
      
      After successful login, users are redirected to a dashboard.
      
      The user dashboard presents a demo layout of Sanothimi Campus’s website, showcasing:
      
      Basic campus information
      
      Simple and user-friendly interface

🛠 Admin Features
      Admin can log in using predefined admin username and password.
      
      Upon login, admin gains access to the admin dashboard, where they can:
      
      View all registered users’ data
      
      Read, Update, and Delete user records
      
      Perform basic user management operations
